## About 

Live Auctions over the Lot-Tissimo auction platform display the current price and asking price of an item.
However, some auction houses employ a buyers premium, often in percentage of the hammer price.

This can be quite high and depending on the asking price, add a significant amount of money on top.

This extension extends the pricing table of a live auction item with an additional row that display the asking price including the buyers premium.
The buyers premium can be individually set in the extension popup and is also reflected in the auction item pricing info.
